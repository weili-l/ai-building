# ai-building
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Helping people build their own AI


## Background

It's a time when AI is rampant and can be used in almost any industry to help improve efficiency and productivity, and people should be able to create their own AI that meets their goals to drastically improve their personal quality of life or fulfill their needs

* Most people don't know how to write code
* Many people do not have knowledge of algorithms
* Many populations have poor mathematical modeling skills
* etc.


## How is it used?

This AI can be placed in a website to mimic the current AI conversational websites that give appropriate algorithms or code commands to the user after they have given a command.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods


## Challenges

Understanding AI algorithms and code is hard enough; building AI models that help people create AI is even harder



## What next?

Keep going and make this society better
